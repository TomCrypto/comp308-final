<TODO: write brief notes about project and/or implementation here>

Instructions
------------

    To build and run the program, either open the Project.sln solution file or
    execute the makefile depending on whether you are on Windows or Linux, and
    then compile the program using `make` or by having Visual Studio build it.

    The compiled program will be generated in the `bin` folder and can then be
    run, note that the working directory of the program is the `bin` folder so
    for Windows double-clicking will work, for Linux please cd into the folder
    before executing the program, e.g. as follows:

        make && cd bin && ./Project; cd ..

    The following dependencies are not provided and need to be installed:

       OpenGL, GLU, GLUT

Folder Contents
---------------

    The different folders and their respective purpose are enumerated below:

        - `bin`: output folder for the final executable
        - `doc`: supporting documentation (paperwork, SIGGRAPH papers)
        - `lib`: third-party libraries, excluding OpenGL-related libs
        - `res`: assets used in our project (textures, models, etc.)
        - `src`: C/C++ source code and headers
