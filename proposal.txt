Title: Photo-Realistic interactive lens flare and atmospheric rendering.
Objective: Lens flares and sky rendering are computationally expensive and not usually rendered in real-time applications. We want to implement some of the more photo-realistic techniques given in recent SIGGRAPH papers. Our aim is to come as close as possible to xxxxxxx.


Task Allocation.

Member 1: Rendering & Animation 
	Topic: Adding photorelistic lens flares, which change dynamically. 
	Methods: Light difraction, screen space convolution, fast fourier transform
	References: http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/lensflareRendering/
	
Member 2: Lighting & texturing
	Topic: Sky rendering (light sources), large scene model interface.
	Methods: Atmospheric scattering and illumination, extend obj parser for multiple textures.

Plan & Milestones

13th of September: Scene display & Dynamic camera, basic lens flares
27th of September: Sky/night rendering, dynamic lens flares, interactive controls
7th/8th october: bug fixing, optimization
17th october: extras (physics, night/day sky)
